# Steps for coding the 'Soldier & Dice (Risk)' Game:

- I will ask for the number of DEFFENDERS (soldiers)
- I will ask for the number of ATTACKERS (soldiers)
- Here starts de round.
- If necessary, I will ask for the number of dices for DEFENDERS
- If necessary, I will ask for the number of dices for ATTACKERS
- I will random each dice for ATTACKERS and show the results.
- I will random each dice for DEFENDERS and show the results.
- I will compare the biggests results for each pair ATTACKER - DEFENDER
- I will show the results on how many soldiers loses each part / player

# BONUS
There are some extra tasks to do if I have enough time:
1. Ask for the names of the 2 players.
2. Insert some pictures of dices: blue for defenders, red for attackers.
3. Other extra stuff.
