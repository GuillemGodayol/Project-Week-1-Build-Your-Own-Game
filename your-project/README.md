## Project Description
The project consists in a Risk battle, with some soldiers defending a territory and others attacking it. The result of this battle is evaluated by dice rolls. I chose this game because I've played many times at Risk.

## Rules
One player is the Defending team, who wants to keep his territory.
Other player is the Attacking team, who wants to conquer a new territory.
The Attacking team must attack with more than 1 soldier, as he can't leave his own territory unoccupied.
After the rolls, the player with more alive soldiers wins the battle, and keeps or wins the territory.

## Workflow
As I knew the game before, I didn't need to check the rules, so the steps I went through were:
1. Firs I read the instructions and check the repo, forked and cloned.
2. Prepare a Kanban in Trello with all the steps.
3. Decide the software to be used and prepare the .gitignore file.
4. Prepare the map or pseudocode to get the main ideas or parts for the code.
5. Write the code.
6. Test the code and re-write it. 
7. Update the readme file.

## Organization
To get organized I used Trello, with 3 columns: Steps, Work in Progress, Finished.
It helped me to know the pending steps and to decide when to hurry.

The repository is quite simple: 
one folder named 'pictures', where you can find a picture of my Kanban in Trello
one folder named 'your-project', where you can find this readme.md file, the code (named 'soldiers_&_dice') and the pseudocode.md

## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
